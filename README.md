## Reflection
- Stalled this to the bone. Could've finished this in a day, but whatever.
- Struggled on scoping shit in javascript but everything else is fine.
- Forgot **return** existed so had to spend an extra 30 minutes trying to stop clicks.
- Best part of this is when I finished this shit.

## Summary
Luck based lol.

Asuka supremacy. **AYAYA!**
